assignment 1 :

Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)

Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.

Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy

Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier

Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier

Implement and apply a Softmax classifier

Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier

Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
